 Place holder coming soon 
 in advance recommended hardware. 
 1. mellow ercf board
 2. 2 binky pcb / encoder ( original is to unreliable with sourcing / calibration hastles)
 3. its possible the "2.0" will come out "soon" namely this will just be easier for users to assemble. however the 1.1 if assembled correctly / good print settings shouldn't offer much difference.
