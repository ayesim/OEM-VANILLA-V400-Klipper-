1. 
Delta has a set order of events,  its always these commands in this order , probe_calibrate to get "probe offset"   Next is delta_calibrate to "trame the effector to the bed (aka leveling )
Finally mesh can be used to "touch up" any topography issues on the bed, this only works if delta_calibrate is accurate otherwise it will cause other problems or just be a bandaid for underlying issues. 
Note Mesh is rarely wrong but can have confusing results. The first thing is to check the bed for bad spots on the mesh to verify how accurate it is. this can done with a straight edge for flatness or 
look for things like dimples / dents or rub a dry cloth across the bed to find ruff spots ets.  Also check the magnet for the same this will afffect leveling, 


Bed leveling seems to never work: 
If on "stock" pad firware / modified projects "Tramming" aka leveling the effector to the bed. is disabled. short anwer it expects factory perfect conditions otherwise relys on bed mesh
to band aid out issues. This also means the effector itself is moving wrong leading to inaccurate bed mesh. this effectivly  means a mix of motion issues / bed mesh topography reflected on the 
mesh.  Further "kliper screen doesn't use Probe_calibrate , its using babystep rendering zoffset inaccurate. the zoffset dispalyed in mainsail is actually  "babystep" or temporary offset
normally this is in a range of 0.00 - 0.05 -0.010 etc small values depending on paper thickness or human haptic feedback error. (touch / feel is subjective)  

- usually the simplest solution is , only revert delta.py to official undoing "changes" the changes to it, would make sense in a factory not so much after shipping qc / user assembly. 
its better to be able to deal with some degree of imperfection vs not at all.  

an  alterate solution, is to install just "klipper" official and, Klipper screen leaving the rest. for normal behavior and, access to accurate docs on the klipper website regarding expected behavior. 

The more proper solution would be to enable remote ssh admin (just google this for ubuntu)  sign in as admin / root. remove pi user. readd user as admin, then reinstall the projects based on their github instruction.
Note kiauh can work othertimes it'll break things , its a helper tool nothing more. this heavily depends on how upto date it is with current projects. its also nammely intended for debian / supported devices.
other notes, xfce remains installed (full desktop) this could also be removed,  
relivent to currently 1.1-1.3 pad firmware.   
Note everything is none standard here.... and, not klippers expected behavor or install methods, its normally mainsailos image, or btt images (bigtree is a supported "partner/sponsor"  with raspiflasher
otherwise, a minimal clean image. (add whatever you want only namely for more advanceed linux users) further raspi-flasher for "pi" has mainsailos on the install menu. so pretty "ezy"  otherwise 
ratos is another option. Note fluiddpi-os is now deprectiated and, not under active support. The current install method for mainsail or fluidd is "kiauh'   


Faq:

My probe is broken 
The option to get around this exists in Klipperscreen, the option dela_calibrate method=manual with a feeler guage will allow "manuaL traming" 

My probe doesn't seem to be working well 
Using a machinest square or similar check the probe is in perfect alignment to the tip of the nozzle if not it will probe reliably wrong as "kevin O conner puts it" (kliper creator)
regarding "kossell" style probes.. and, will tramm the effector or probe moount, instead of what were printing with... 



Seemingly unsolvable leveling problems and, places to check,
-if nothing obvious can be found its time to checklist for other areas 
- Belts should be even tension to start off with.
- check towers with a machine square these should all be 90 , check the front to back for gaps between towers / loose screws 
- check steppers are not "loose" the towers must come off for this, all 4 screws should be the same torque, the torque drivers will help with this,
- check the carriages / sliders are "level / square with. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5973131
- check the carriages for "rocking" / bumps / debree. if they rock this means the eccentric nut behind the carriage block is loose, this should checked with belts loose. 
- use 2.0 nm torquedriver on all bed screws to ensure this is even, same principle as a car wheel. 
- if carriages are loose remove tension from belts , then remove the 4 screws slide the carriage down loosen the 3 set screws , use 1 or 2 allen keys to turn it, just enough to remove any play, 
- if carriages are poor qc, they may need to slide off the rail and a small amount of cleaning behind the nut might be required, to take the eccentric nut off, undo the middle wheel first 
then the nut should pop off, use a red dremel buffing sponge (basically scotch brites)  and remove any burrs / other imperfection a dash of lube or ptfe spray. reassemble. 
-check probe itelf is square and, not tilted in some way, its possible for the abs to be a bit warped simply take off the pcb and sand it flat. redo probe_calibrate. 

2. 
hotennd 

- check all screws are tight when hot / nozzle 
- check both setscrews on the block are tight 
- note the v400 fan conver has a rectangular slit, this is for the allen key to go though to get to the set screw located on the heatsink and, below is another near the heatbreak, 
- intermittent problesm 
- random clogs 
check fan connector isn't being yanked or fan connector isn't loose / otherwise damaged in some way. (wiggle it) with hotend above 50c to see if it has connection problems. 
- make sure the wires have a bit of slack at the connector pcb they shouldn't be stressed. 
- hotend bent / breaking 
1. avoid excessive travel speeds just enough to avoid stringing is all that is required or certain situations with really large travels may need a bit more. the higher this is the harder it hits blobs etc. 
2. printing "slow" and it breaks"  avoid using excessive temperateures most blocks are good up to 300c, 300c is typically just used to hot tighten the nozzle, otherwise the aluminum will become to soft. leading to 
breaks tearing out / bending / some mix of breakage. Note e3d blocks use a "alloy" allowing a bit more  if printing 300c or above copper is used to avoid these problems other then just thermal transfer reasons. 
Newer units 
im not cetain of the solve the pc standoffs used as supports are known to both leak tons of heat into the effector plate creating problems with fans or may be a potential firehazzard at ranges above 280
taking these off isn't a great idea since leaving them off would mean a tiny thin pipe is unportected (heatbreak) leading to a bend or worse. 



3. 
Strange noises 
Rattle , check fans if not stock its possible for the metal to become bent during removal these need to be "perfect" to avoid the fans hitting the case. fast printer movements may promote this. 
rubbing noises , to state the obviouse check belts 
-check carriages for pla
-check rails /rods for burrs these can be solved with fine sand paper 1000-2000 or just wiping with a cloth, 
-check for filament debree on rods 
- fan makes noise on start up then goes away. either replace the fan or B ptfe spray usually fixes it. The fan is either dirty or brearing is worn 
- check pulleys , if worn these can be found from flsun page or direct email. (larger bore with adapter) a bit none standard. 


4. slicer problems 
profiles are to fast for begginers start at 30-60mms get perfect prints, Then typically you can scale the profile up. not doing this you wont be able to see where quality degradation starts
or other issues you wont be able to even see, other then hear it scraping etc. or, things like extrusion limits for the filament. other cases certain brands just have slower thresh holds high temps
won't nessasarily help.  e.g not all filament lists what it exactly is persay. quite a few are "designed" for enders being the most common printer"  this often means lower melt temps lower speeds potentially. 
/ other variables. 

The current knon stable versions of slicer are 
use custom machine deff for full features.... like nozzle size / intended cura settings for features to work. (note you can have both) 

cura 5.40 - u
orca 1.64 

prusa 2.50

superslicer currently unknown, 

ideamaker, not the beta namely its the same with faster profiles for the raise machines, but complains about acc being to high. most cura templates also work.

#1 out of box check the usual, everything on the hotend is tight when hot. if not it will leak 

$2 Do not low ball temps on the sr, it uses cloned e3d, This block "works' but thermistor placement isn't great and, it has a exposed meltzone leading to thermal loss (nozzle stuck out of the block) 
the general temp is 220 9/10 on pla their is always exceptions of course. keep in mind its running 2200-3000 acceleration in marlin and, above in klipper. relative to other printers this means its generally
hitting request speed more often then not. As a result it needs more temp dumping out more filament plus the bowden is somewhat long.  Failure to keep this in mind typically leads to damaged extruder. end of the day
the filament can only backire one place and, that back into e.  

3. couplers are moving 
unlike some types of couplers the stock couplers do not require clips they will not sovle this problem either. 
if the tube is not seated all the way up it will have a gap and shift with every retract otherwise leak,  leave the coupler  1/8 loose then push the tube all the way up, tighen the coupler. if on the hotend, preheat this
first.  Note the ptfe tube must be cut flush to seal.  the side of the ptfe going into the extruder optially you can also bevel the tube / countersink so the filament inserts slightly easier. 

4. Do not waste your money on bimetal breaks or risk your house to a fire, simply put the mosquito design protects these since they bend on a dime 1mm thin tubes aren't strong never mind highspeed deltas. 

alignment. same as the v400 machinest square, 

rails. if binding, you must loosen rails screws a bit. start on 1 half of the rail. start at the middle screw work your way up tightening this will "flatten the rail solving the binding / bumps" hence all the holes 
some units may need to tap in a feww more screws. once one half is done do the other half. 

if rails are rocking / loose this means the bearins in the carriage needs to be replaced or easier the whole rail.  

Do not take them off like some youtube videos.... typically if they fall easy or not all it means bad tolerances or its simply not flat but will be torqued down.  
Do not use wd40 other then for cleaning dirt / old oil.  ptfe dry lube spray is the usual recommend or the lube it comes with. 

Some beds raise more then others. on some units it may be needed to loose the bed clamps this may lead to calibration issues 

pei. 
pei on the sr must be installed on the glass. The reasons for this are the bed is super thin and will bow a bit with probing if the printer crashes z its going to bow , and, lasly the middle has no support
The glass doubles as the support, namely its done this way to heat the glass quick vs thick metal then glass ontop. 





extruder noise, This is not the bmg at fault. This is loud due to mounting on a hollow sheet metal box, the solution is either print a tpu stap or hang the extruder decoupling it from the frame,
