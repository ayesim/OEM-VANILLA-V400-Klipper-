Basics everyone should have in general. 

Wire brush for nozzle cleaning

1.9-1-8mm (just under 2mm wire) for heagt break clog removal. some stores may havee thse. 

Machinest square to ensure axis is square / other parts 

Reasonable quality calipers 

Multimeter. Things happen eventually everyone should be able to at least runa continunity test for bad wires etc or verify things like heater wattage "claims"

 Good set of allen keys / Drivers / bits.  low quality keys just lead to stripped screws and, make assembly / maintainece take longer then it should.

 G900 or boron nitride. pc paste simply is not rated for hotend temps... all metal hotends heatsinks need optimal thermal transfer to avoid clogs. 
 Nitride can/will improve transfer on nozzle threads / heater cart / thermistor filling in the gaps. 

jst/xht crimps / crimpers  nothin magic about heaters or thermistors its typically better to order these in bulk or make minor repairs on other wires 


Good quality Soldering iron. t12 , hakko , aouya yihua "some" wellers" avoid the None digital mostly suited for wires
tinning solder - not quite the same as reg solder recoats the tip / restores it if badly oxidised 
no clean flux,  
63 ,37 solder
heatshrink
some type of helping hands. printed or bought
