These must be m mounted to a ridgid place. ideally in metal. Do not mount on plastic fan mount or on fans. (rattling bearings) The hole on the stock V400 duct is to get to the setscrews to remove the heatbreak. 
Btt does have a pcb for the extruder stepper Motor, fystec and similar placement is a bit more awkard.  

Belts make sure to check the pulleys on the top for belt deformation. this means belts are to tight, im still not aware of a correct and, documented spec way with guitar tuners. This does have a speciic method . e.g corexy with "gates brand belts"
(yes it matters) is axis back from the front measured 150mm pulley pin to tensioner pin at 100-110 hrz. The delta carriages would need somthing as specific also. 

Sr assembly does not have "centering pins" 
use a machinest square to check things over and, towers are not angled left / right.  always use a diaganol patern when installing / tightening screws.  if its 4 screws this would be a X pattern, This is for alignment reasons. 

Beds 
on the gen 1 and 2 sr (metal clamps) ensure these are not excessivly tight this is known to affect delta_calibrate/mesh. if to tight the bed may lift fighting the camps at certain temperatures (you need to check this
every priners differnt) e.g mine raises maybe 1-2mm at 80c, 

Stock sr hotends 
Expect to print higher temps then the rolls. namely if coming from slower printers your printing all around faster this ends up needing more. failure to do so commonly damages the extruder. This is a overtime affect
typically from excessive force trying to extrude. a bmg or similar gear box with full size stepper has more then enough torque to always extrude. The problem it will also backfire on itself possibly damaging the filament path or reducing the filament to a spring coming out the lever. Further part of the temp difference relates to the clone block thermistor placement, its not reading the nozzle like the real design, and, also the nozzle is stuck to far outside  the meltzone.
