Profile Notes / intent 

Silk pla 0.1 = Max quality - Designed to deal with random prints / avoid ghosting. Brand cc3d metal rainbow silk.
Note: Damping feet required unless you like hop noise :/ 
Goes with cc3d material proile. (shoudld work for most silks) if not adjust temps etc. 


Petg 
red-green = 0.2 muliprint on bed , parts , cosmetics. Designed to always print, can be scaled up with feedrate (depending on filament viscosity) 
Note these colors are A-typically slower. "semi transparent will usually run quicker. This can also be used as a base / starting point for all colors otherwise. 

Black generally runs quite a bit faster note temps are typically on the low side, prone to showing extruder noise if printing to hot. (vertical line / diaganols /diamonds patterns)
