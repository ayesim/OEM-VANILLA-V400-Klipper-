Optional "klipper mod" / fix namely this avoids dented beds in the middle / adverges the middle and, follows a circle vs the pentagon. lastly the pentagon is offset a bit at the front / less then the back.
Note: This wont "solve" real mechanical related issues , eg. uneven belts , loose carriages  , unlevel probs to nozzle. etc. 

Simply open putty/winscp / whatever network file manager 

navigate to klipper then klippy then extras drop the file on / overwrite. or also copy it off, (you can get the file off klipper git / restore with update manager)
Note: this is simply a fast easy patch im not sure how long feature reqests will take / dev discussions.
