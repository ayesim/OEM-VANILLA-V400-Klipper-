Exception. 


If the user can install / revert project to their supported state these would again follow docs / work with the website aka manual. 
However the con is installation remains much harder then it should be / time consuming,  you will also be missing critical features depending on boot loader such as 
bootable ssd/hdd

.  clonable able ssd /hdd 

.  standard mostly setup o.s images / project support

.  on some devices you have no fall back to data loss if bootable media is not removable. e.g devices blows up no sdcard etc to remove / get data off with pc. 
the only option is repair it. 


.  Well known issues and solutions. Exception social media pages may have the solution or may not con you have sift through opinions/missinfo  to find facts on the matter. or some solutions may not be up to date.  


.  Reliable and, trustworty updates  (updates should only be coming from ubuntu, or debian main servers for the o.s) Klipper and other installed projects only need to update with the updater in mainsail/fluidd


FLASH TOOls  RASPI-FLASHER this also has the option to download mainsailos for pi devices 
belena etcher , has sdcard cloning funcion. useful to update a bunch of printers or simply make backups. very useful for print farms / identical machines. 




WHY ARE THEY NOT SUPPORTED? 

In a nutshell devices not following the standard installation or original files simply are confusing users and, creating conflicting users posts / questions / assumptions. 


This leads to impossible to support scenarios and, forces the user to be ultra specific on questions that shouldn't be.  E.g we'd need to know the device , device changes , device problems and, if its a user error or the device at fault. 
to even begin to get started. 

Users become confused on where the problem is. and, the official projects get blammed for issues of 0 relation. 

Projects cannot solve / update issues that don't exist. 

These devices do not help the actual projects with dev or simple things like bug reports or new ideas. 

some devices have none standard ui leading to confusing ansewrs and questions in relation to buttons / commands. or, some buttons may have completly different behavior then expected. 

updates do not keep up eventually leaving the users far out of the loop. in some cases this could be a steep learning curve or require a good page read on recent changes found on the website.
